That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant  difficulty (e.g. ""Can my phone run this game?""), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. ""What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion.""),  make a particular post with the ""discussion"" flair.

**Older codes that still work if you haven't used them**

* SBNBUK67M37Z

* GS6ACJ775KNV

* GENSHINGIFT


Added codes for the Chinese version, huge thanks to /u/illuminati160801 (and the [Genshin Wikia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Promotional_Codes)) for them!

Redeem codes in game or here: https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/gift Thanks for the reminder /u/esist27 

**If you're on PS4/PS5 make sure there's no space after the codes!** Thanks to /u/Mystic_Arts for this one!

Stream has ended, that's all folks!

Edit: To everyone thanking me: I'm so glad I could help! Share the codes with your friends before the English stream starts as that's usually when the codes run out of uses! ~~And help me clear Abyss lmao~~

Oh and please don't miss the [English stream](https://youtu.be/wgNiGj1nGYE) just because you have the codes, the English VAs are fantastic and past streams were a ton of fun!

Edit 2: This blew up, follow m- I'm just kidding I don't have a Twitter. But if you've read this far... if there's enough interest I'm planning on writing a Discord bot so you could get new codes even faster. I'd be crowdsourced in the sense that there'd be a few trusted submitters who could send pings out immediately and if enough regular users submit the same code that'd get sent out as well.
